Description: A code searching tool similar to `ack`, with a focus on speed.
 What's so great about Ag?
 .
 * It is an order of magnitude faster than `ack`.
 * It ignores file patterns from your `.gitignore` and `.hgignore`.
 * If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search, just add
   their patterns to a `.agignore` file. (\*cough\* extern \*cough\*)
 * The command name is 33% shorter than `ack`, and all keys are on the home row!
 .
 Ag is quite stable now. Most changes are new features, minor bug fixes, or
 performance improvements. It's much faster than Ack in my benchmarks:
 .
     ack test_blah ~/code/  104.66s user 4.82s system 99% cpu 1:50.03 total
 .
     ag test_blah ~/code/  4.67s user 4.58s system 286% cpu 3.227 total
 .
 Ack and Ag found the same results, but Ag was 34x faster (3.2 seconds vs 110
 seconds). My `~/code` directory is about 8GB. Thanks to git/hg/svn-ignore, Ag
 only searched 700MB of that.
